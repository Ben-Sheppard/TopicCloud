# TopicCloud #
This is a repo to house my attempt at the Frontend Topic Cloud challenge.

## Overview ##
The structure of my attempt is as follows:
Backend: Node + Express
Frontend: Backbone

## How to run ##
Firstly, pull this repository onto your machine, then:

- cd ~/{directory you pulled into}/TopicCloud
- npm install
- node server.js

After you have started the Node backend you will then be able to access the frontend by opening the index.html file (found in the root directory) in a browser.
